A Stacks testnet faucet is a tool that gives you free testnet STX (tSTX) — 

mock Stacks tokens used on the Stacks testnet so you can build, test, and experiment with smart contracts, transactions, and apps without real financial cost or risk. These tokens have no real-world value and can’t be used on the mainnet.
